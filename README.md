# Agar.io Clone

This project is an **Agar.io-inspired game** built using **Pygame**, where players control cells that grow by eating food, shooting bullets, and battling enemies in various game modes like **Classic Mode**, **Battle Royale**, and **Team Mode**. The game also includes a shrinking safe zone mechanism similar to **Fortnite**.

## Features

- **Multiple Game Modes:**
  - **Classic Mode**: Standard Agar.io-like gameplay where the goal is to grow and dominate the map.
  - **Battle Royale Mode**: Fight against enemies in a shrinking safe zone until only one player remains.
  - **Team Mode**: Players are divided into teams and compete to grow and score the most points.

- **Weapons:**
  - Players can acquire weapons like **guns** and **RPGs** to shoot bullets and attack other cells. Weapons are unlocked based on the player's mass.

- **Dynamic Enemy AI:**
  - Enemies can move, grow, shoot weapons, and react to the shrinking safe zone in **Battle Royale Mode**.

- **Flag Selection:**
  - Players can choose a country flag for their cell, which is displayed along with the player's name.

- **Safe Zone Mechanism:**
  - In **Battle Royale Mode**, a shrinking safe zone forces players to move toward the center of the map, or they take damage.
